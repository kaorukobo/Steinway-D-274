You can, but it's not recommended.

The filters have been tweaked to fit normal songs, not Black MIDIs.
Hammers could also hide the main melody. (Like a real piano would do with crazy remixes, don't you think?)

The best presets for Black MIDIs are the one without hammers, or the ones without hammers on low notes.
