# Keppy Steinway Piano: A piano soundfont for free
It's back!

# I'm searching for a more realistic soundfont, where can I find one?
There's Steinway B-211 for that, click here: https://github.com/KaleidonKep99/Steinway-B-211

## Description
Do you want to just play standard MIDI files with piano samples, without having to pay for them?
<br>
Well, this is the right project for you!
<br><br>
Welcome to the Keppy's Steinway Piano project page on GitHub, where you can download a piano soundfont for free!
<br><br>
Please consider adding these lines to your video's description, to support the SoundFont:
<br>
"This soundfont was made by KaleidonKep99, you can find it here: https://github.com/KaleidonKep99/KSP-Reborn"

## Wasn't it "realistic"?
That was my original intent.
<br>
<br>
All the feedback I got through e-mails actually made me change my objective for this project... Talking with a [close friend](https://www.youtube.com/user/gingeas) helped me realize that.
<br>
From the idea of "Realism --> Good sound", I switched to "Improvements by other's feedback --> Good sound", which is good.
<br>
But on the other hand, it's also not good at all, since it made me lose the initial objective of the project...
<br>
<br>
Things said, it's up to the user itself to find the project "Realistic" or "Artificial", I just followed my fanbase's requests.
<br>
So... I hope you like it. If you don't... Well, just remove it from your computer I guess.

## Main features
- Sampled from a Steinway D-274 Concert Grand!
- HQ samples, WAV 16bit, 128-point sinc, 1536kbps. (There are exceptions)
- Dynamic filtering, to emulate key pressures. (No velocity layers, ultrarealistic presets are an exception)
- Multiple presets for all the tastes!
- Can be edited as pleased with a generic notepad program! (Even the one built-in on Windows)

## I thought it was dead?
So did I.
I've been thinking about all the users who considered it an important part of their musical training, so I decided to give it back to them!
Also, I'm pretty sure there are multiple mirrors available, to let other users download it. So yeah...

Sorry again for the trouble, and enjoy the SoundFont.
