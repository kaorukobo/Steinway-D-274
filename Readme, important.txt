Please consider adding these lines to your video's description, to support the SoundFont:
"This soundfont was made by KaleidonKep99, you can find it here: https://github.com/KaleidonKep99/Keppy-Steinway-Piano"

This soundfont is splitted in different versions.

Let me explain quick what are them:

Presets folder contains:
KSP - Concert Grand: The standard one. There are different versions.
KSP - Classic Grand: A more classic sounding one, if you don't like the brightness of the Concert Grand.
KSP - Bright Piano: Same thing as the previous one, but with less bass.

The damperless SFZ files are for MIDIs without MIDI events, to make them more realistic.

Hope you like my work! Enjoy!
